Auto Form-Filling Agent Development Plan
1. Core Features
1.1 Knowledge Management

Local knowledge graph storage
User input via terminal
Form data extraction (PDF, web forms)
Image data extraction
Knowledge update from filled forms

1.2 Form Filling

PDF form filling
Web form filling
Interactive filling process
Knowledge gap handling

1.3 User Interface

Terminal-based UI
PDF viewer integration
Web browser integration

2. User Journey

Setup: User installs the application and runs it in the terminal.
Knowledge Input: User inputs personal information via terminal or uploads documents/images.
Form Selection: User chooses between PDF or web form filling.
Form Processing:

For PDFs: User provides path, agent opens and fills the form.
For web forms: User indicates which browser tab to fill.


Interactive Filling: Agent fills known fields, prompts user for unknown (or unsure/conflict) information.
Review and Confirm: User reviews filled form and confirms submission.
Knowledge Update: Agent updates knowledge graph with new information.

3. Development Phases
Phase 1: Core Functionality

Set up project structure and environment
Implement local knowledge graph storage
Develop terminal-based UI for user interaction
Create knowledge input module (terminal input)
Implement basic PDF form filling (using a PDF library)
Develop web form filling module (using browser automation)

Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Implement document/image upload and data extraction
Enhance PDF and web form filling with interactive prompts
Develop knowledge update mechanism from filled forms
Implement browser integration (Chrome extension or Chromium embedding)

Phase 3: Refinement and Optimization

Improve user experience with better error handling and feedback
Optimize knowledge graph for faster querying and updates
Enhance form field recognition and auto-filling accuracy
Implement security measures for storing sensitive user data

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)

Migrate to a database system for improved scalability
Implement a GUI for easier user interaction
Add support for more document types (e.g., images of forms)
Develop an API for integration with other applications

4. Technical Stack

Language: Python (for its rich ecosystem and ease of use)
Knowledge Graph: NetworkX or RDFLib
PDF Processing: PyPDF2 or pdfrw
Web Automation: Selenium or Playwright
Browser Integration: Chrome extension (JavaScript) or CEF Python
NLP: spaCy or NLTK for text processing
Image Processing: OpenCV and Tesseract for OCR
LLM Integration: OpenAI API, Claude api

5. Challenges and Considerations

Ensuring accurate form field recognition across various formats
Handling diverse web form structures and JavaScript-based forms
Balancing automation with user privacy and data security
Managing the complexity of knowledge graph updates and queries
Ensuring cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

6. Testing Strategy

Unit tests for individual modules (knowledge graph, form filling, etc.)
Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
User acceptance testing with diverse form types and user scenarios
Security audits for data handling and storage
Performance testing for large knowledge graphs and complex forms

7. Deployment and Distribution

Package the application for easy installation (e.g., pip, executable)
Create clear documentation and user guides
Set up a system for user feedback and bug reporting
Plan for regular updates and feature releases

This development plan provides a structured approach to building your auto form-filling agent. It breaks down the process into manageable phases while considering the core features, user experience, and technical challenges.
